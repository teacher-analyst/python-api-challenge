# python-api-challenge
This repository is broke down into two deliverables, WeatherPy and VacationPy. 

WeatherPy uses OpenWeatherMap Api to visualise the weather of over 500 cities of varying ditances from the equatior. The WeatherPy file has the script as well as scatterplots that plots Latitude data against varies weather conditions such as maximum temperature, cloudiness and wind speed. A linear regression line is applied to each scatter plot and the the relationship between both axis in each plot is discussed.

VacationPy uses citipy Pyhon Library as well as Geofy API to generate the longitude and latitude coordinates of each city. Then, cities with certain weather conditions are filtered, hotels in each of these filtered cities are identified and plotted on a map.
