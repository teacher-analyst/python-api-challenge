# python-api-challenge
This project is part of Module 6 Challenge of Data Analytics Bootcamp. 

## Project Description
### Problem
Data's true power is its ability to definitively answer questions. So, let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?" 

Now, we know what you may be thinking: “That’s obvious. It gets hotter.” But, if pressed for more information, how would you prove that? 

### Files supplied
 

### Deliverables
1.Create a Python script to visualise the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. You'll use the citipy Python library and the OpenWeatherMap API.
2.Use Jupyter notebooks, the geoViews Python library, and the Geoapify API and your weather data skills to plan future vacations.
